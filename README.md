# Conversion Program Assignment (CSE1321)

webpage portion is very unoptimized because I wanted to try and make it object oriented just like the assignment 

functions correctly now, if we wanted to, we could change the time conversion thing to include all states rather than just time zones, which wouldn't be that hard to do

everything works though, that's all that matters.
